# 1) set up the model
spectral_grid = SpectralGrid(trunc=31, nlayers=8)

model = PrimitiveWetModel(spectral_grid; shortwave_radiation=OneBandShortwave(spectral_grid, clouds = DiagnosticClouds(spectral_grid; use_stratocumulus=true)))

# 2) attach the callback before initializing the simulation, since
# initialize!(model) is what calls SpeedyWeather.initialize! on cb.
# Pass an explicit schedule - Schedule() with no arguments is not guaranteed
# to mean "every timestep", and relying on its default is what caused the
# callback to only ever record the initial (pre-run) state previously.
#
# record_maps=true (the default) captures a full spatial snapshot of all 9
# raw fluxes at every recorded step, enabling the "Show Flux Maps" viewer
# below - this uses more memory than the scalar time series alone. Set
# record_maps=false if you only want the time series / arrow diagram and
# want to skip the map storage and its per-step overhead entirely, e.g.:
#   cb = TrenberthCallback(schedule=Schedule(every=Day(1)), record_maps=false)
cb = TrenberthCallback(schedule=Schedule(every=Day(1)))
add!(model.callbacks, :trenberth => cb)

# 3) initialize and run
sim = initialize!(model)   # this will call SpeedyWeather.initialize! on cb
run!(sim, period=Day(20))  # or your usual run invocation

# --- sanity checks -----------------------------------------------------
# If cb.timestep_counter is only 1 after the run, callback! never fired -
# check the `schedule` passed to TrenberthCallback above.
