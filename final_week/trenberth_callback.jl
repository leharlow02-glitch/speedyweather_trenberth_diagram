# TrenberthCallback: a SpeedyWeather callback that records Trenberth energy
# budget diagnostics at every (scheduled) timestep of a simulation
#
# This file defines:
#   - TRENBERTH_LONGNAMES : human-readable names/units for each flux variable
#   - time_to_float        : small helper to convert DateTimes/Periods/Numbers to Float64
#   - TrenberthCallback    : the callback struct + constructor
#   - initialize!/callback!/finalize! : the three lifecycle hooks SpeedyWeather calls
#   - show_var_names/to_dataframe     : convenience helpers for inspecting results
#
# Usage pattern (see bottom of file for a worked example):
#   cb = TrenberthCallback(schedule=Schedule(every=Day(1)))
#   add!(model.callbacks, :trenberth => cb)
#   run!(simulation)
#   # cb.data now holds one Vector{Float64} per flux, one entry per recorded step
#
# UPDATED FOR SpeedyWeather.jl v0.22:
#   - initialize!/callback!/finalize! used to take separate
#     progn::PrognosticVariables, diagn::DiagnosticVariables arguments.
#     As of v0.22 there's a single vars::Variables object instead - see
#     initialize!/callback!/finalize! below.
#   - progn.clock -> vars.prognostic.clock (the Clock itself didn't move,
#     just where you reach it from).
#   - calc_trenberth_from_diagn now takes `vars` instead of `diagn` - see the
#     companion calc_trenberth_from_diagn.jl update.

"""
    TrenberthCallback

A SpeedyWeather callback that records Trenberth energy-budget fluxes
(see `calc_trenberth_from_diagn`) at every scheduled timestep.

Fields:
- `timestep_counter` : how many times `callback!` has fired
- `data`             : `Symbol => Vector{Float64}`, one vector per flux variable (global mean/sum time series)
- `maps`             : `Symbol => Vector{Any}`, one vector of spatial grid snapshots per raw
                       flux (see `TRENBERTH_MAP_VARS`), one snapshot per recorded step. Each
                       snapshot is kept on the model's native (often reduced, e.g.
                       OctahedralGaussianGrid) compute grid rather than reinterpolated to a
                       rectangular grid, to keep storage as small as possible during the run;
                       the reinterpolation needed for plotting happens lazily in
                       `plot_trenberth_diagram`, only for the timestep actually being viewed.
                       This still stores a full 2D field at every recorded step, so it can use
                       a lot of memory for long runs or high resolutions.
- `times`            : elapsed seconds since the simulation started, one entry per recorded step
- `datetimes`        : the original `DateTime` for each recorded step
- `start_time`       : simulation start time as a Unix timestamp (Float64)
- `SumFlag`          : passed through to `calc_trenberth_from_diagn` (sum vs. mean)
- `var_longnames`    : human-readable names, used by `show_var_names`/`to_dataframe`
- `record_maps`      : if `false`, skip capturing/storing spatial map snapshots entirely
                       (both `maps` and the extra work in `calc_trenberth_from_diagn` to
                       produce them) - only the scalar time series (`data`) is recorded.
                       Turn this off if you don't need the maps viewer and want to save
                       the memory and per-step overhead. Defaults to `true`.
- `schedule`         : a SpeedyWeather `Schedule` controlling how often this callback runs

# Convenience constructor - the only constructor this struct has. We
# deliberately do NOT use `Base.@kwdef` on the struct above: @kwdef
# auto-generates a keyword constructor with the exact same (zero positional
# arguments, keyword-only) signature as this one, and defining both is a
# silent redefinition that only warns interactively - under module
# precompilation it's a hard "Method overwriting is not permitted" error.
# Every struct still gets a plain positional constructor automatically
# (with or without @kwdef), which is what we call at the bottom of this
# function - that one has a different signature (10 positional args) so it
# can't collide with this one.
#
# Storage vectors always start empty and grow with `push!` in
# `initialize!`/`callback!`. We deliberately do NOT pre-allocate to a fixed
# `nsteps + 1` length here, because mixing pre-allocated `undef` slots with
# later `push!` calls silently produces a vector with garbage values in the
# middle and real values appended past the end. Dynamic growth is a little
# slower for very long runs, but for a diagnostic callback like this the
# difference is negligible and correctness matters more.
