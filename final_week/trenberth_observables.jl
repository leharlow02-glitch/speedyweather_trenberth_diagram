# Building Observables from a TrenberthCallback's recorded data
#
# This file turns the raw `cb.data` (a Dict of plain Vector{Float64}, one per
# flux, filled in by TrenberthCallback during the run) into the Observable
# objects the animated diagram needs: a vector of per-timestep NamedTuples,
# a slider index, and a "current point" that automatically updates whenever
# either of those change.
#
# Run this *after* the SpeedyWeather simulation has finished and `cb` is
# fully populated.

    build_trenberth_observables(cb; skip_first=true)

Convert a `TrenberthCallback`'s recorded data into the Observables used by
the Trenberth diagram and time-series plots.

Arguments:
- `cb`          : a `TrenberthCallback` that has already been run (i.e. has
                  populated `cb.data` and `cb.datetimes`)
- `skip_first`  : if `true` (default), drop the very first recorded entry.
                  The first entry is the *initial condition*, captured before
                  the model has taken any timesteps. Its fluxes are often
                  unrepresentative (e.g. zero/uninitialised physics tendencies),
                  so by default we exclude it from the animated series.

Returns a NamedTuple with:
- `flux_series`  : Vector{NamedTuple}, one entry per (kept) timestep
- `history_obs`  : Observable wrapping `flux_series`
- `time_idx`     : Observable{Int}, the currently selected timestep (slider position)
- `current_point`: Observable{NamedTuple}, derived from `history_obs[time_idx[]]`
- `ts`           : NamedTuple of plain Vectors, one per flux, for static/full time-series plots
- `maps`         : Dict{Symbol, Vector}, one vector of grid snapshots per raw flux (see
                   `TRENBERTH_MAP_VARS` in trenberth_callback.jl), index-aligned with
                   `flux_series`/`time_idx` so `maps[:OLR][time_idx[]]` matches `current_point[]`
- `nsteps`       : number of timesteps kept (== length(flux_series))
